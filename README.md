# Pattern-Recognition

This repository contains MATLAB (ver. R2018a) files that implement the following machine learning algorithms 
by reference to the book "Pattern Classification (2nd Edition)" written by Duda, R. O., Hart, P. E. and Stork, D. G. (2000).
I manually coded rather than using machine learning related built-in functions to deepen understanding of each algorithm.

1. Nonparametric Density Estimation (Ch.4)
  1. Parzen windows
  1. k-nearest neighbor estimation

1. Perceptron (Ch.5.5, Batch and fixed-increment single-sample perceptron, Minimum Squared Error procedure and Least Mean Squared procedure)
