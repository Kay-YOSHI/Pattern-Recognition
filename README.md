# Pattern-Recognition

This repository contains MATLAB (ver. R2018a) files that implement the following machine learning algorithms 
by reference to the book "Pattern Classification (2nd Edition)" written by Duda, R. O., Hart, P. E. and Stork, D. G. (2000).
I manually coded rather than using machine learning related built-in functions to deepen understanding of each algorithm. 

1. Discriminant Functions (Ch.2.6)
1. Nonparametric Density Estimation (Ch.4)
    - Parzen windows
    - k-nearest neighbor estimation
1. Perceptron (Ch.5.5)
    - Batch perceptron
    - Fixed-increment single-sample perceptron
    - Minimum squared error (MSE) procedure
    - The Widrow-Hoff or least mean squared (LMS) procedure
