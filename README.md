# Pattern-Recognition

This repository contains MATLAB (ver. R2018a) files that implement the following machine learning algorithms 
by reference to the book "*Pattern Classification (2nd Edition)*" written by Duda, R. O., Hart, P. E. and Stork, D. G. (2000).
I manually coded all algorithms to deepen understanding of them rather than using machine learning related built-in functions.
